## Introduction
I am an aspiring linguist working in IT consulting and marketing. Working with \*NIX systems is something I enjoy deeply, even though sometimes things need quite some help before they work in the way they are expected. This is rarer nowadays, but happens from time to time. I'm also interested in data visualization and telling stories with data and technology. At this time, I am writing my BA thesis about cognitive metaphor in Macbeth with some corpus linguistics mixed into it.

+ My personal portfolio will *hopefully* someday reside [here](https://juhokajava.fi/). It is my previous foray to the wonderful world of GitHub Pages. It has been edited with a web interface called Stackbit, and deployed via Netlify. I'm hoping that someday it will have a comprehensive list of my skills.
