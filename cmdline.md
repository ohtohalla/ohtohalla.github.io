# Command-line Course

This was a great course that aimed to demystify the seemingly opaque workings of \*NIX command-line. It started with basic navigation and progressed towards more advanced topics such as bash scripting and version control via Git. A variety of tools from text editors to commands such as `grep` and `sed` were introduced.

We also learned about corpus processing on the command line. It is fascinating how some things seem to be easier via the command line than by using some other tools or language. 

## Week 1: Introduction to Command Line Environments
During the first week we learned about command line environments and what they are all about. There are many/certain things that can be achieved faster and more easily via a command line than via a GUI. An example of this might be an installation of a program with a package manager.


## Week 2: Navigating the UNIX System
We learned about basic \*NIX navigation commands such as `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, and others. We also learned about flags that one can append to certain commands. An example would be listing also the hidden files in a folder with `ls -a` instead of normal `ls`. We also learned about processes and how those could be monitored, managed, and killed. Then we learned to establish a connection to a remote server with `ssh`. Personally I had some problems with my CSC account and could not establish a connection, but connecting to a remote server is quite familiar to me from previous experience.


## Week 3: Basic Corpus Processing
This week we learned about `grep` and regular expressions as well as about standard streams. The most important thing I personally learned during this week was standard streams and how they can be utilised and/or directed around. It was also a good refresher on differences on DOS and \*NIX text files and regular expressions. This is the time that regex finally "clicked" in my head and it was quite easy to write them for the first time in my life.


## Week 4: Advanced Corpus Processing
Sed is the most important thing I learned about during this week. It had been on my "I'll get to this later" list of things to look up, so it was a pleasant surprise that it was included in to the course curriculum. The next thing is probably to deepen my knowledge on `sed` and then to look up `awk` to accompany it. We also learned about the pipe `|` and about how it works.



## Week 5: Scripting and Configuration Files


## Week 6: Installing and Running Programs


## Week 7: Version Control
